If you already have other mods, that use BepInEx (like the ones mentioned below) or MelonLoader or the package manager, you can skip installing the mod loader.

### Install the mod loader

(You can skip this if you already have a mod loader)
1. Download the newest version of BepInEx 5.4.x ([BepInEx Download](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases))   If you are not sure which to choose, download it directly from here: ([Direct Download](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip))

1. Find your game installation folder (The folder with `PlateUp.exe` in it). The default installation is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PlateUp\PlateUp\ `

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive into the game folder.

1. Run the game once before installing any mod to initialize the mod loader.

### Install Save System

1. Download the newset version of the mod from here: 
   [Save System v1.2.0 BepInEx](https://github.com/Aragami-delp/PlateUp_Mods/releases/latest/download/SaveSystem_BepInEx.dll)
   [Save System v1.2.0 MelonLoader or Package-Manager](https://github.com/Aragami-delp/PlateUp_Mods/releases/latest/download/SaveSystem_MelonLoader.dll)

1. Find your plugin folder within the game folder. (`\PlateUp\BepInEx\plugins\` or `\PlateUp\Mods\`). If the folder doesn't exists make sure to run the game at least once after installing the mod loader.

1. Put the file `SaveSystem_,,,.dll` into the plugins folder.

   If everything works correctly, there should be a new menu in the options menu, when you are in the game lobby.
