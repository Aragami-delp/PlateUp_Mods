- Make sure old save won't be lost - like moving it into a backup folder, but only if there is already a run
- NTH: name of save
- Save current active save - DONE
- Maybe only save the newest file of the current run, not every save for every day
- What if no backup exists exists? - Prop an excpetion right now
- Change load button multiple times, if current run is not saved yet
